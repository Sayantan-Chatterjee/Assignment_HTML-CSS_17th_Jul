1.What is the difference between em and rem?

Ans:-While em is relative to the font-size of its direct or nearest parent, rem is only relative to the html (root) font-size.
    em gives the ability to control an area of a design. 
    As in, scale the type in that specific area relatively. rem gives the ability to scale type across the entire page easily.
